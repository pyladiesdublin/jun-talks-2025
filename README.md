### About Laura Brennan (Senior Data Scientist, Optum)
Laura has recently moved into a data science role, having initially spent 5 years working in consulting and project management. Bored of just speaking about other people's work, she learned python and has pivoted to a role as a data scientist.
I have 8+ years in the tech sector, creating solutions that scale. I worked in consulting in Italy and the US on cybersecurity for manufacturing, started a Web Agency serving small businesses, had two startup experiences (one bad, one good). For the past two years, I've been leading a team of Developers in Dublin, Ireland for AWS.
